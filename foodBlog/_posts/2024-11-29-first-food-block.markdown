Everyone loves pizza, and making homemade dough is always a treat. Given our increasingly health conscious world, here is my take on my (mostly) whole wheat pizza crust.

<!--excerpt-->

Okay, so this dough won't be *completely* whole wheat, because white flour just gives a fluffier texture. I've experimented with several different types of crusts and increasing the proportion of whole wehat flour generally led to a less fluffy and more hard crust. That being said, you are always free to adjust the proportions based on your preferences. 

## Ingredients 

You will need 

- 1 cup of warm water (I find that 20 seconds in a microwave gives a good temperature)
- 2 teaspoons instant yeast 
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- 1 tablespoon sugar (I use brown, but I can't see how white sugar would make a difference)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil 
- 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour 
- 1.5 cups of white flour 
- You'll need extra flour/oil to ensure the work surface is lubricated and nothing sticks

As mentioned above, feel free to experiment with the proportions of whole wheat to white flour. Everyone prefers a different style of crust!

## Instructions 

1. Start activating the yeast. Drop the yeast into the warm water and wait for the yeast to rise. You don't technically need to do this separately, but my yeast has been inconsistent in the past, so I do this just to make sure the yeast is still active. 

2. If you haven't risen the yeast separately, mix the water and both types of flour into a large bowl. If you have let the yeast rise beforehand, mix the flour and your water-yeast mixture. Also, add your sugar and salt to the mixture now

3. Beat this mixture using your stand mixer. People love to give times, but there is no magic number of minutes to countdown: it all depends on your flour and even your environment. You'd want to mix until there is no unincorporated flour. 

4. About halfway during mixing, add your oil. This gives the dough some extra flavor and imparts a smooth and silky texture. 

5. You also need to pay attention to the texture of the dough. Traditionally, pizza dough should be very wet, but we're not going for a super wet dough. The dough should feel damp to the touch, but shouldn't be soaked. Add more flour if the dough is too wet; add more water if it is too dry. 

6. Once the dough is mixed, it is time to let it rise. I've always done this using my oven's "keep warm" setting for about 15 minutes, then letting it rest in the oven until I'm ready to start making the pizzas. If your oven doesn't have such a setting, you could do it in a warm part of your house (but room temperature should be fine too, it might take longer then).

If everything worked out well (namely, if your yeast is of good quality), the dough should have doubled in size in about one or two hours (again, how long it would take depends on the environment you placed your dough in). 

That's it, your pizza dough is ready! Not too much work (bless my stand mixer) went into it.
