I am Nilay Tripathi, a first year PhD student at Michigan State University. Previously, I was at Rutgers University--New Brunswick as an undergraduate student where I majored in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. 

Vaguely, my research interests are largely in algebraic topology, low dimensional topology, differential geometry, and its adjacent areas. Within these fields, I am open to looking for new problems to solve.

Beyond mathematics, I am also interested in computer science and often embark on CS projects in my free time. I am particularly interested in lower-level systems programming (so programming at the operating system or kernel level) and artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

My CV is [here](/assets/cv.pdf) (last updated: 11/30/2024)
