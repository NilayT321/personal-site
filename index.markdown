I am Nilay Tripathi, a senior at Rutgers University where I am majoring in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. I am also an aspiring Ph.D. student and will be applying during the Fall 2025 admissions cycle. 

Vaguely, my research interests are largely in algebraic topology, low dimensional topology, differential geometry, and its adjacent areas. Within these fields, I am open to looking for new problems to solve.  

Beyond mathematics, I am also interested in computer science and often embark on CS projects in my free time. I am particularly interested in lower-level systems programming (so programming at the operating system or kernel level) and artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

My CV is [here](/assets/cv.pdf) (last updated: 11/30/2024)
