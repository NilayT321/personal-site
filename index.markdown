Hello there! I am Nilay Tripathi, a rising senior majoring in mathematics, statistics, and minoring in computer science. I currently attend Rutgers University and am an aspiring Ph.D. student, who will be applying for the Fall 2025 cycle.

In mathematics, I am vaguely interested in algebraic and differential topology and would like to pursue a Ph.D. in these fields. Apart from mathematics, I am also interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Namely, I am interested in the mathematical foundations behind deep learning neural networks.
