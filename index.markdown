Hello there! I am Nilay Tripathi, a senior at Rutgers University where I am majoring in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. I am also an aspiring Ph.D. student and will be applying during the Fall 2025 admissions cycle. 

Vaguely, my research interests are largely in algebraic topology and differential geometry. 

Beyond mathematics, I am also interested in computer science and often embark on CS projects in my free time. I am particularly interested in lower-level systems programming (so programming at the operating system or kernel level) and artificial intelligence and machine learning.
