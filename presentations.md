This page lists many of the expository presentations I have given during my student career. 

## Talks

Title: Introduction to Homology Groups & Applications (*RUMA Seminars* [^1]) <br>
**Abstract**: Algebraic topology is a field of mathematics that studies topological spaces through algebraic invariants. In this talk, we discuss homology groups, one of the most widely studied and important topics in modern topology. We will give an introduction to homology groups, some elementary computations, and some applications to see what we can learn from them.

## Directed Reading Program 

The Rutgers University Directed Reading Program (D.R.P.) is an extra-curricular program within the mathematics department where an undergradaute mentee and a graduate student mentor are paired and read about a topic of interest. The program culminates in a presentation given by all participants at the end of the semester. Their homepage is [here](https://sites.google.com/view/rutgersdrp).

I participated in a DRP during the Fall 2023 and Summer 2024 semesters. The presentations are linked below. 

- Summer 2024: "Smooth Manifolds & Symplectic Geometry" ([Slides](/assets/presentations/SymplecticDRP.pdf)) <br> **Abstract**: We start by giving a brief overview of topological manifolds, smooth structures on manifolds, and differential forms. We then discuss the basic concepts and definitions regarding symplectic manifolds and some brief applications in Hamiltonian mechanics.

- Fall 2023: "An Overview of Hermite Polynomials" ([Slides](/assets/presentations/HermitePolynomials.pdf))

## In-Class Presentations 

I gave two presentations as a part of two of my classes. The presentations are linked below
