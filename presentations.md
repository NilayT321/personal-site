This page lists many of the expository presentations I have given during my student career. 

## Directed Reading Program 

The Rutgers University Directed Reading Program (D.R.P.) is an extra-curricular program within the mathematics department where an undergradaute mentee and a graduate student mentor are paired and read about a topic of interest. The program culminates in a presentation given by all participants at the end of the semester. Their homepage is [here](https://sites.google.com/view/rutgersdrp).

I participated in a DRP during the Fall 2023 and Summer 2024 semesters. The presentations are linked below. 

- Summer 2024: "Smooth Manifolds & Symplectic Geometry" ([Slides](/assets/presentations/SymplecticDRP.pdf)) <br> **Abstract**: We start by giving a brief overview of topological manifolds, smooth structures on manifolds, and differential forms. We then discuss the basic concepts and definitions regarding symplectic manifolds and some brief applications in Hamiltonian mechanics.

- Fall 2023: "An Overview of Hermite Polynomials" ([Slides](/assets/presentations/HermitePolynomials.pdf))

## In-Class Presentations 

I gave two presentations as a part of two of my classes. The presentations are linked below

- Spring 2024, "de Rham Cohomology" ([Slides](/assets/presentations/deRhamCohomology.pdf)) <br>
Given as a part of Math 412, Mathematical Analysis II 

- Fall 2023, "Banach & Hilbert Spaces: An Introduction to Functional Analysis" ([Slides](/assets/presentations/BanachHilbertSpaces.pdf)) <br>
Given as a part of Math 441, Introductory Topology I
